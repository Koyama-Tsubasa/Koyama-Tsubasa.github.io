## About Me

I am a software engineer at [Pegasus Verification System](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/digital-design-and-signoff/silicon-signoff/pegasus-verification-system.html) within [Cadence Design Systems, Inc.](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home.html)
I am interested in the realm of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), particularly in the domain of algorithmic thinking.

Before joining Cadence, I pursued my MSc in Computer Science from [National Tsing Hua University (NTHU)](https://nthu-en.site.nthu.edu.tw/), and obtained my BSc in Computer Science and Information Engineering from [Tamkang University (TKU)](https://english.tku.edu.tw/) in Taiwan.
During my graduate studies, I had the privilege of conducting research under the guidance of [Prof. Tsung-Yi Ho](https://tsungyiho.github.io/) and had the valuable opportunity to collaborate extensively with the [Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) Group](https://ase.aseglobal.com/#gsc.tab=0).

My motto is "Per Aspera Ad Astra," a sentiment that reflects my aspiration to triumph over every challenge that comes my way throughout my entire life journey.
